            Do you know how many characters there are in the Simpsons Morty? There's like a-a billion characters, M-Morty. There was an episode where Former President BUSH was their neighbor! You're growing up fast, Morty. You're going into a great big thorn straight into my ass. Stealing stuff is about the stuff, not the stealing. It's called carpe diem Morty. Look it up.

    I just killed my family! I don’t care who they were! They'll just fall right out of my ass! I've done this too many times! This is it, Morty! It's full circle from the pilot! Full circle! … Oh, I guess we, uh… I guess we both just had to take a shit. I just wanna die!
    <br><br>
    Dont look at me! That guy over there roped me into this. Full disclosure, Morty - it's not. Temporary superintelligence is just a side effect of the Megaseeds dissolving in your rectal cavity. What, you think I'd waste our home teaching you a fucking lesson? I am gonna miss this place, though: Johnny Carson's still alive and on the air, 9/11 never happened, and Rocky Road ice cream has peanut butter and jelly instead of marshmallows. 5 more minute of this and I'm going to get mad!

    I'd like to order one large person with extra people please. white people, no no no black people... and hispanic on half.
